# Internet-Map

*Creates a map based on the hyperlinks for a target page using a web crawler.*

It takes a source URL starting from which the map has to be created. It also takes the number of layers (depth of the graph i.e. the number of hyperlinks starting from the original URL) till which the crawler will go.
